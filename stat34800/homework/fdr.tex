Exercises: multiple testing, FDR}

\bigskip

\begin{enumerate}
\item Consider the following setting in the context of ``multiple hypothesis tests".
Let $i=1,\dots,n$ index individuals and $j=1,\dots,m$ index genes (or pixels in an image if you prefer). Assume we have
measurements on each individual at each gene for ``treatments" $k=0,1$. Let $Y_{ijk}$ denote the
measurement on individual $i$, gene $j$, treatment $k$, and let $D_{ij}$ denote the difference between the measurements
in the two treatments: $D_{ij}:= Y_{ij0}-Y_{ij1}$. We will assume that $D$ is sufficient for all our inferences, and so you can forget about $Y$ now and work
only with $D$: I just wanted you to understand where $D$ might come from in principle.

We will assume a model for $D$:
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:D}
D_{ij} | \beta, \sigma \sim N(\beta_j, \sigma_j^2)
\end{equation}
where $\beta=(\beta_1,\dots,\beta_m)$ is a vector of ``treatment effect"s, where
$\beta_j$ is the effect at gene $j$, and $\sigma=(\sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_m)$ is a vector of 
standard deviation parameters. 
For each gene $j$ we wish to test
the null $H_j: \beta_j=0$ (that is, that there is no treatment effect). For simplicity you can assume that $\sigma_j=1$ is known for all $j$. You can also assume that $n=10$ and $m=1,000$.

Assume that the true effects
$\beta_j$ are independent, and identically distributed, with 
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:B}
\beta_j \sim \pi_0 \delta_0 + (1-\pi_0) N(0,\sigma^2_b).
\end{equation}
where $\delta_0$ denotes a point mass on zero.
That is, $\beta_j=0$ with probability $\pi_0$, and $\beta_j\sim  N(0,\sigma^2_b)$ with probability $1-\pi_0$.

\begin{enumerate}[i)]
\item Write an R function to simulate data $D$ under this model, for user-specified $\pi_0$ and $\sigma_b$. The function
should take $\pi_0$ and $\sigma_b$ as input, and return a list, with elements $D$ (a matrix) and $\beta$ (a vector).
\item Write an R function to compute a $p$ value $p_j$ for each column of the data matrix $D$, testing $H_0:\beta_j=0$.  
This function should take as input the data matrix $D$ and output a vector of $p$ values. You can use any reasonable two-sided test, but state which test
 you use. Apply your R function to data simulated under
a) $\pi_0 = 1$, b) $\pi_0=0.5, \sigma_b=3$; c) $\pi_0=0, \sigma_b=3$. Provide histograms of the $p$ values in each case and comment on their distributions.
\item Write an R function to apply the Benjamini--Hochberg rule to control FDR at a user-specified level $\alpha$.
This function should input a vector of $p$ values, and a level $\alpha$, and output a vector of binary (0/1) indicators, $\gamma=(\gamma_1,\dots,\gamma_m)$ say,
where $\gamma_j=1$ indicates that the rule would reject $H_j: \beta_j=0$.
\item Write an R function to compute the empirical False Discovery Rate (i.e. the number of false discoveries divided by the number of discoveries)
for any given value for the vector $\beta$ of true values of $\beta$, and the vector $\gamma$ of reject decisions. That is, the function should return $V/R$ in the notation of the notes. Remember to deal correctly with the special case of no discoveries, $R=0$.  
\item Perform a simulation study to estimate the actual FDR ($\E(V/R)$) achieved by the BH rule in the three cases a), b) and c) above. In each case
perform the test procedure for different levels $\alpha$, and plot the estimated $\E(V/R)$ as a function of $\alpha$ (say for $\alpha =(0.05,0.1,\dots,0.5)$).
Comment on the results. [NOTE: to estimate the actual FDR you have to estimate $\E(V/R)$ where the expectation is over datasets $D$. To do this you
will want to do a simulation study where you simulate a large number of datasets $D$, not just one dataset!]
\item Repeat the simulation study, but this time estimate the pFDR instead of the FDR, and plot this as a function of $\alpha$.
\end{enumerate}

\item The {\tt qvalue} package in R implements Storey's approach to estimating FDR. To install this package use
\begin{verbatim}
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("qvalue")
library("qvalue")
\end{verbatim}
The package takes a vector of $p$ values, and outputs a list which includes an estimate of $\pi_0$ (obtained
using the $p$ values near 1) and a vector of $q$ values.  Try, for example, for a vector of $p$ values {\tt p},
\begin{verbatim}
res=qvalue(p)
res$pi0
res$qvalues
\end{verbatim}

The $q$ value for a particular observation is an estimate of the pFDR 
if you reject all things that are as or more significant than that observation.
You can convert the vector of $q$ values into a list of reject decisions at a given $\alpha$ level (the $\gamma$ vector above) 
using, say,
\begin{verbatim}
compute.gamma=function(q,alpha){return(q<alpha)}
\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}[i)]
\item Repeat the simulation study above, using {\tt qvalue} instead of the BH procedure. Produce plots of the FDR vs the $\alpha$
level for {\tt qvalue} and compare them with those obtained for BH.
\item Perform a simulation study (e.g. by modifying the simulations you have already performed), to see how accurately {\tt qvalue} is able to estimate the
proportion of nulls $\pi_0$. Try varying  $\pi_0$ from 0 to 1 for at least 3 different values of $\sigma_b$, and in each case provide plots of the true $\pi_0$ vs
the estimated $\pi_0$ from {\tt qvalue}. Comment on the results.
\end{enumerate}



\item Now consider implementing an Empirical Bayes approach to this problem. To do so, given data $D$ we will need two steps:
\begin{enumerate}[A]
\item Estimate the hyper parameters $\pi_0,\sigma_b$ in (\ref{eqn:B}) by maximum likelihood. Call the estimates $\hat\pi_0, \hat\sigma_b$.
\item Compute the posterior distribution $p(\beta_j | D, \hat\pi_0,\hat\sigma_b)$ for each $j$.
\end{enumerate}
This question takes you through these two steps.
\begin{enumerate}[i)]
\item Define $\bar{D}_j = (1/n) \sum_i D_{ij}$. Show that the vector $\bar{D}:=(\bar{D}_1,\dots,\bar{D}_m)$ is sufficient for $\beta$. 
That is, $p(D|\beta) \propto p(\bar{D} | \beta)$ where the constant of proportionality does not depend on $\beta$. [This means that,
as far as inference for $\beta$ is concerned,  the likelihood $p(D| \beta)$ is equivalent to the likelihood $p(\bar{D} | \beta)$, so from now on you can treat $\bar{D}$ as
your data instead of $D$.] 
\item Derive an expression for the log-likelihood $l(\pi_0,\sigma_b) :=\log(p(\bar{D} | \pi_0,\sigma_b))$. [Hint: note that the $\bar{D_j}$ are independent given $\pi_0,\sigma_b$]
\item Write an R function to compute the log-likelihood $l(\pi_0,\sigma_b)$, or alternatively $l(\theta_1,\theta_2)$ where 
$\theta_1 = \log(\pi_0/(1-\pi_0)), \theta_2 = \log(\sigma_b)$. [The motivation for this reparameterization is that $\theta_1,\theta_2$ can take
any value on the real line.] Try using the R function optimize (or another method if you prefer)
to maximize the likelihood over $\pi_0,\sigma_b$ (or $\theta_1,\theta_2$).
[You may or may not find that this works... it is a somewhat tricky numerical problem. The reparameterization may help. Alternatively if you know about the EM algorithm
you can try that.]
\item Derive the posterior distribution $\beta_j | D,\pi_0,\sigma_b$. Hint: this posterior should be a mixture of a point mass at zero and a normal distribution. 
It may help to first derive $p(\beta_j = 0 | D, \pi_0, \sigma_b)$, and then $p(\beta_j | D, \pi_0,\sigma_b, \beta_j \neq 0)$.
\item Implement a method that computes $p(\beta_j = 0 | D, \hat\pi_0, \hat\sigma_b)$. Implement another method that takes these probabilities and rejects those tests $j$ for which this probability is $<\alpha$. Add this method to your simulation study and see how it performs. (If you are unable to get the optimization for $\pi,\sigma_b$ to work then
you can ``cheat" in this step and use the true value of $\pi,\sigma_b$.)
\end{enumerate}
%\item The library {\tt ashr} (for installation instructions, see the README at \url{www.github.com/stephens999/ashr}) 
%implements an empirical Bayes approach to the above problem. In contrast to the BH procedure, and {\tt qvalue},
%instead of
%working with the $p$ values for each test, it works with a vector of estimates of the elements of $\beta$ ($\hat\beta$), and their corresponding standard errors ($s$).
%In outline, the method first estimates the distribution, $g(\cdot; \pi)$, of $\beta_j$ from the data, where $\pi$ are hyper parameters to be estimated by maximum likelihood (this is
%why it is ``Empirical Bayes"). Then, given the mle $\hat\pi$, it computes the posterior probability of $H_j$, $\Pr(H_j | \hat\beta_j, s_j, \hat\pi)$, and
%other posterior quantities of interest (like the posterior mean for $\beta_j$). It returns a lot of things, but for this exercise all you need to know is that it returns a vector of $q$ values (same interpretation as those from {\tt qvalue}).
%If {\tt betahat} is a vector of the estimates, and {\tt s} is a vector of the standard errors, then you can apply {\tt ash}, and obtain the $q$ values, as follows:
%\begin{verbatim}
%res.ash = ash(betahat,s, method="fdr")
%res.ash$qvalue
%\end{verbatim}
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Write a function that computes, from data $D$, a vector of estimates of $\beta$ ({\tt betahat}) and their corresponding (estimated) standard errors ({\tt s}).
%Note that under the null, {\tt betahat/s} will have a normal distribution, so \verb|betahat^2/s^2|
%has a chi-squared distribution
%so you can compute a vector of $p$ values using 
%\begin{verbatim}
%zscore = betahat/s
%pval = pchisq(zscore^2,df=1,lower.tail=F)
%\end{verbatim}
%For one simulated data set plot a graph of the $p$ values you get this way against the $p$ values you used for the BH procedure to check that they are highly correlated.
%
%\item Repeat the simulation study from questions 1 and 2, showing estimated FDR vs $\alpha$ level, using the {\tt ash} $q$-values. Compare results with
%BH and {\tt qvalue}. Do all three methods provide conservative control of FDR? 
%
%\item In addition to control of FDR, it is also of interest to compare methods in terms of {\it how many discoveries} they make (say when
%controlling the FDR at $\alpha=0.05$).
%Take one of the simulation scenarios and compare the methods on how many discoveries they make at FDR=0.05.
%\end{enumerate}

%\item Return to the exercise in \verb|exercises/seeb/train_test.R| and  Exercise sheet 3 Q2. Throughout this question you may now fix $\alpha=0.5$ in the prior on the allele frequencies.  The aim here is to use an Empirical Bayes approach to estimate the proportion of individuals that came from each group in a training set, and then apply this to a test set.
