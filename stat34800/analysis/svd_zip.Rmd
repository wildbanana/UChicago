```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Here we read in the "zipcode" training data, and extract the 2s and 3s.
```{r}
z = read.table("../data/zip.train.txt")
sub = (z[,1] == 2) | (z[,1]==3)
z23 = as.matrix(z[sub,])
```

Now we run svd (excluding the first column which are the labels)
```{r}
z23.svd = svd(z23[,-1])
```


Plot the first two two singular vectors, colored by group,
we see the second sv separates the groups reasonably well.
```{r}
plot(z23.svd$u[,1],z23.svd$u[,2],col=z23[,1])
```

And a histogram suggests a mixture of two Gaussians might be 
a reasonable start:
```{r}
hist(z23.svd$u[,2],breaks=seq(-0.07,0.07,length=20))
```
