#Here is the Exercise:
#The idea is that you want to see if you can correctly classify the individuals in the test set
#based on the information in the training set.
#1. At each locus, use the training set to estimate the allele frequencies (ie proportions) in each of the four subpopulations.
#Assume for the remainder of this exercise that these allele frequencies from the training set are the "true" frequencies in each population.
#2. For each individual in the test data set, compute the posterior probability that it arose from each of the four populations, assuming
# that all four populations are equally likely a priori. You can assume that the 12 loci contribute independently to the likelihood. THat is, the likelihood is defined
# by multiplying the likelihood across loci.
#3. If you ``assign" each individual in the test set to the population that maximizes its posterior probability, 
# what is the error rate? (ie how many individuals are misassigned vs correctly assigned?)
#4. Comment on any problems you came across as you did this exercise, and how you solved them. Your answer
#should include all your R code in a format that can be run to reproduce your results (I recommend using RStudio and
#the knitr package to produce your report).
